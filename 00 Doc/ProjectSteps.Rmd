Run through the Data Import Wizard, giving the table a name and identifying the types that each column represent.

Once you are finished with this, the data has been stored in the database.


In our particular case, the data has been stored on a cloud-based database. An SQL query will be used to extract the dataframe from the database for access during the project. The following query is used:

```
df <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('129.152.144.84:5001/rest/native/?query="select * from DATAFRAME"'),httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@129.152.144.84:1521:ORCL', USER='C##cs329e_UTEid', PASS='orcl_UTEid', MODE='native_mode', MODEL='model', returnDimensions = 'False', returnFor = 'JSONLITE'), verbose = TRUE)))
```
